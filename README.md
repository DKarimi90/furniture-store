# FURNITURE-STORE-APP

## Goals 
- Create a `mini` React furniture web app using personal REST-API<br>
- Integrate all skills learnt so far (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and Git)<br>
- Identify my Strong and Weak areas within the coding context


## Project Description 
For this project, I was developing a mini React App to test my learnt skills as at that stage. I was testing on Routing, useState, useEffect, useFetch, useParams and other technologies. 
## Project Set-Up
You can use the `deployment` link to view it on live server. Please ensure you have `node` installed in your machine before running the project. ALternatively, you can clone this project to your machine. Kindly install all the required dependencies by executing the CLI cmd `npm install` before you can run it in live server using `npm start`. 

#### User Features
Users should be able to navigate through the web app. The app provides a landing page where all items are listed. Clicking or touching on each displays more information about the item. Users can also use provided links in each page for easier navigation.
